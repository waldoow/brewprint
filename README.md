## üèó Architecture

The app follows a **silo-based architecture** where each major feature area is self-contained:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ recipes/     ‚Üê Recipe CRUD and brewing logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ equipment/   ‚Üê Grinder and brewing method management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ beans/       ‚Üê Coffee bean inventory and tracking
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ journal/     ‚Üê Brewing history and analytics
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ settings/    ‚Üê App preferences and user profile
```

Each silo contains its own:

- Stack navigator and screens
- Business logic and data handling
- Feature-specific components
- Type definitions

## üé® Design Philosophy

### Visual Identity

- **Minimalist Interface**: Clean, distraction-free brewing experience
- **Coffee-Inspired Palette**: Warm caramels, rich browns, cream tones
- **Typography**: Manrope for UI, Playfair Display for headings
- **No FABs**: Header-based actions for better accessibility

### User Experience

- **Guided Workflows**: Step-by-step recipe creation and brewing
- **Contextual Actions**: Right action, right place, right time
- **Offline-First**: Core functionality works without internet
- **Fast Input**: Quick entry methods for common actions

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g @expo/cli`)
- iOS Simulator or Android Emulator

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone [repository-url]
cd coffee-app
npm install

# Start development server
expo start
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Structure**: Follow the silo-based organization
2. **Types**: Define interfaces in `/types` before building
3. **Components**: Build reusable UI in `/components`
4. **Testing**: Test on both platforms regularly
